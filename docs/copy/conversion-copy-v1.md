## Positioning Statement

**SnowPro Armenia is the only platform to book certified ski and snowboard instructors at Armenian resorts — no booking fees, verified locals, instant confirmation.**

Key differentiators vs. current WhatsApp-based booking:

- Every instructor is verified, reviewed, and local
- No fees to customers (10% commission from instructors)

## 1. Hero Section

### BEFORE (Current)

> **Headline:** "Ride Armenia's mountains with a pro"
>
> **Subheading:** "Book certified ski and snowboard instructors at Tsaghkadzor, MyLer, and Jermuk. Direct contact, real locals, no middlemen."
>
> **CTAs:** Find Your Instructor / How It Works

### AFTER (Recommended)

> **Headline:** "Your Instructor. Your Mountain. Book in 60 Seconds."
>
> **Subheading:** "Browse verified ski & snowboard pros at Tsaghkadzor, MyLer, and Jermuk. See real reviews, check live availability, and lock in your lesson — no booking fees, ever."
>
> **Primary CTA:** Browse Instructors
> **Secondary CTA:** See How It Works

### Why This Works

- **Headline** shifts from generic ("ride with a pro") to specific benefit (speed + control). "60 seconds" creates urgency and reduces perceived effort.
- **Subheading** adds three trust signals missing from current: verified, real reviews, live availability. "No booking fees, ever" is the strongest competitive claim — leads with customer savings.
- **CTAs** use action verbs. "Browse" is lower commitment than "Find" — matches the instructor-first browsing pattern from competitive analysis.

### Stats Bar (Keep, but sharpen labels)

| Current | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| 3 Resorts | 3 Resorts |
| 6+ Pro Instructors | 6+ Verified Pros |
| 54km Total Slopes | 54km of Runs |
| 2,850m Peak Elevation | 2,850m Peak |

## 2. Resort Cards

### BEFORE — Tsaghkadzor

> "Armenia's classic mountain — where legends are made"

### AFTER — Tsaghkadzor

> **Tagline:** "Armenia's flagship resort — 30km of runs, 50 minutes from Yerevan"
>
> **Description:** "The mountain every Armenian skier knows. Seven lifts serving everything from gentle nursery slopes to steep off-piste. Night skiing on weekends. The best instructor selection of any Armenian resort."
>
> **Quick Facts:** 30km Slopes · 7 Lifts · 2,819m Peak · ~50 min from Yerevan
>
> **Season:** Mid-December to April
>
> **CTA:** Find Instructors at Tsaghkadzor →

### Why

- "Where legends are made" is vague. Replace with concrete facts that help someone decide: distance from Yerevan (decision-critical for same-day trips), slope variety, night skiing.
- CTA links directly to filtered instructor list for that resort (reduces clicks).

---

### BEFORE — MyLer

> "The new standard — international quality, Armenian soul"

### AFTER — MyLer

> **Tagline:** "Armenia's newest resort — modern lifts, extended season, uncrowded runs"
>
> **Description:** "Built to international standards with snowmaking that keeps runs open into April. Seven high-speed lifts, zero weekend crowds. The best-kept secret for riders who want quality without the queues."
>
> **Quick Facts:** 21km Slopes · 7 Lifts · 2,850m Peak · ~1hr 15min from Yerevan
>
> **Season:** December to April (extended with artificial snow)
>
> **CTA:** Find Instructors at MyLer →

### Why

- "International quality, Armenian soul" sounds like a hotel tagline. Replace with what actually makes MyLer different: newer infrastructure, snowmaking, less crowded. These are real reasons to choose MyLer over Tsaghkadzor.

---

### BEFORE — Jermuk

> "Beginner-friendly slopes + famous hot springs. The perfect family combo."

### AFTER — Jermuk

> **Tagline:** "Gentle slopes + legendary hot springs — the perfect first-timer destination"
>
> **Description:** "Small, friendly, and zero intimidation factor. Three kilometers of wide-open beginner terrain, then hot springs to reward yourself after. Ideal for families with kids and adults trying skiing for the first time."
>
> **Quick Facts:** 3km Slopes · Beginner-Friendly · Hot Springs On-Site
>
> **Season:** December to March
>
> **CTA:** Find Instructors at Jermuk →

### Why

- Current copy is close but "perfect family combo" is weak. New copy doubles down on the real selling point: zero intimidation. Parents deciding where to take kids need to hear "wide-open beginner terrain" and "zero intimidation."

## 3. Instructor Cards

### BEFORE — Card Template

> **Name** (Discipline)
> X years experience · Price AMD/hr
> [Long paragraph bio]
> Languages: ...
> Resorts: ...

### AFTER — Card Template

> **Name** · Discipline Tag
>
> **Star Rating** ★★★★★ (X reviews)
>
> **Headline:** [One-line positioning statement]
>
> **Quick Stats:**
> - X years experience
> - From AMD XX,000/hr
> - Languages: AM, EN, RU
> - Resorts: Tsaghkadzor, MyLer
>
> **CTA:** View Profile & Book →

### Why

- Current cards bury the key decision factors. A customer scanning 6 instructors needs: price, rating, language, resort — visible without clicking.
- Long bio paragraphs move to the profile page. Card = quick scan. Profile = deep dive.
- Star rating + review count is the #1 trust signal from competitive analysis.

---

### Instructor Card Copy — Gor Hakobyan

**BEFORE:**
> "Former competitive snowboarder turned instructor. Gor specializes in freestyle and freeride, taking riders from their first turns to hitting the park. Known for his patient teaching style and infectious enthusiasm."

**AFTER:**

**Card headline:** "From first turns to park tricks — competitive rider, patient teacher"

**Profile bio:** "Gor competed on the Armenian snowboard circuit before switching to instruction 8 years ago. He specializes in freestyle and freeride — whether you're strapping in for the first time or ready to hit the terrain park, he'll get you there. Students consistently highlight his patience and the fact that he makes every session fun, even when you're falling."

**Teaching style tag:** Patient · Fun · Progressive

---

### Instructor Card Copy — Anna Sargsyan

**BEFORE:**
> "Anna is one of Armenia's few female ski instructors and a passionate advocate for getting more women on the slopes. She teaches all levels with a calm, encouraging approach that makes even the most nervous beginners feel at ease."

**AFTER:**

**Card headline:** "Calm, encouraging, and great with nervous beginners"

**Profile bio:** "Anna has been teaching skiing for 6 years and is one of Armenia's few female instructors. She has a gift for putting nervous beginners at ease — her calm, step-by-step approach means you'll be making turns by the end of your first lesson. She's also a strong advocate for getting more women on the mountain and runs women-only group sessions on request."

**Teaching style tag:** Calm · Encouraging · Beginner-Specialist

---

### Instructor Card Copy — Arman Gevorgyan

**BEFORE:**
> "A MyLer local since the resort opened, Arman knows every run and secret spot on the mountain. He specializes in advanced technique and carving, helping experienced riders reach the next level."

**AFTER:**

**Card headline:** "MyLer's most experienced instructor — advanced technique & carving"

**Profile bio:** "Arman has been at MyLer since the resort opened and has 12 years of instruction under his belt. He knows every run, every shortcut, and every secret stash on the mountain. If you already ski or ride confidently and want to sharpen your carving, tackle steeper terrain, or refine your technique, Arman is your pick. He also teaches strong intermediates ready to level up."

**Teaching style tag:** Technical · Expert-Level · Local Knowledge

---

## 4. How It Works Section

### BEFORE

> Step 01: Choose Your Resort — "Pick from Tsaghkadzor, MyLer, or Jermuk based on your level and preferences."
>
> Step 02: Pick Your Instructor — "Browse profiles, check specialties and languages, find the perfect match."
>
> Step 03: Book Directly — "Message them on WhatsApp or Telegram. No middlemen, no booking fees."

### AFTER

> **Step 1: Pick Your Resort**
> "Choose Tsaghkadzor, MyLer, or Jermuk. Not sure? Filter by skill level — we'll show you which resort fits."
>
> **Step 2: Choose Your Instructor**
> "Browse real profiles with reviews, languages, and pricing. Read what past students say. Find the right match."
>
> **Step 3: Book & Pay Securely**
> "Select your date, pay a 20% deposit to lock it in, and get instant confirmation. No booking fees. Cancel free up to 48 hours before."

### Why

- Current Step 3 says "Message on WhatsApp" — this is the #1 conversion killer. The new flow reflects the booking system being built: deposit payment, instant confirmation, cancellation policy.
- Step 1 adds a skill-level filter hint (reduces overwhelm for beginners who don't know which resort).
- Step 2 adds social proof ("read what past students say").
- Step 3 addresses the three biggest booking anxieties: cost commitment (only 20%), fees (none), and flexibility (cancel free).

## 5. Social Proof / Trust Bar (NEW SECTION)

### Recommended Addition — Below Hero or Above How It Works

> **"Trusted by 200+ students this season"**
>
> [3 rotating testimonial cards]
>
> _"Gor had my 8-year-old snowboarding by lunch. We've booked 3 more lessons since."_ — Armine K., Yerevan
>
> _"First time skiing at 35. Anna made it feel easy. Already planning a return trip."_ — David M., Moscow
>
> _"Best value ski instruction I've found anywhere. Half the price of the Alps with just as good teaching."_ — Tom R., London

### Why

- Current site has zero social proof. No reviews, no testimonials, no numbers. This is the single biggest conversion gap.
- Three testimonial archetypes: local family (Armenian parent), Russian tourist (key market), and Western tourist (aspirational market). Covers all three language targets.
- "200+ students" — use real number once available. Even "50+ students" is powerful for a new platform.

---

## 6. Final CTA Section

### BEFORE

> **Headline:** "Ready to hit the slopes?"
>
> **Copy:** "The season runs mid-December through April. Don't wait — the best instructors book up fast during peak season (January–February)."
>
> **CTAs:** Browse Instructors / Read FAQ

### AFTER

> **Headline:** "The season's open. Your instructor is waiting."
>
> **Copy:** "Peak season is January through February — the most popular instructors fill up weeks in advance. Lock in your dates now with a 20% deposit and cancel free if plans change."
>
> **Primary CTA:** Book Your Instructor
> **Secondary CTA:** Got Questions? Read the FAQ

### Why

- "Ready to hit the slopes?" is a cliche. New headline creates personal connection ("your instructor is waiting" — someone specific is ready for you).
- Copy creates urgency with specifics ("fill up weeks in advance") rather than vague ("book up fast").
- Mentions deposit model again — repetition of "20% deposit" and "cancel free" throughout the page normalizes the commitment.
- CTA language: "Book Your Instructor" is possessive — psychologically stronger than "Browse Instructors" for a bottom-of-page CTA where users are ready to convert.

## 7. FAQ Rewrites

### Q: How much does a lesson cost?

**BEFORE:** (Assuming generic answer)

**AFTER:**
> "Private lessons range from 10,000 to 18,000 AMD per hour (~$25–45 USD) depending on the instructor and lesson type. That's roughly 3-5x cheaper than equivalent instruction in the Alps. Prices are set by each instructor and displayed on their profile — no hidden fees, no booking surcharges."

### Q: How do I pay?

**AFTER:**
> "Pay a 20% deposit online to confirm your booking. The remaining 80% is charged 24 hours before your lesson. All payments are processed securely through Stripe. You can cancel for a full refund up to 48 hours before your lesson."

### Q: Do I need my own equipment?

**AFTER:**
> "No. All three resorts have rental shops at the base. Tsaghkadzor and MyLer offer full ski and snowboard rental packages starting around 5,000-8,000 AMD/day. Your instructor can help you pick the right gear if you're a beginner."

### Q: What if the weather is bad?

**AFTER:**
> "Your instructor will assess conditions and advise. If the resort closes lifts, your lesson is automatically rescheduled or refunded — your choice. Light snow or clouds? Most instructors will still teach — some of the best sessions happen in fresh snowfall."

### Q: I've never skied before. Which resort should I pick?

**AFTER:**
> "Jermuk if you want the most relaxed atmosphere and hot springs after. Tsaghkadzor if you want the biggest instructor selection and easy access from Yerevan. Both have gentle beginner areas. Your instructor will keep you on appropriate terrain — you won't end up on a black diamond by accident."

### Q: Can I book a lesson for tomorrow?

**AFTER:**
> "Yes. Many instructors accept same-day or next-day bookings if they have availability. Check the calendar on their profile — green slots mean they're free. Peak weekends in January-February book out faster, so plan ahead for those."

### Q: What languages do instructors speak?

**AFTER:**
> "All instructors speak Armenian. Most speak Russian and English as well. Some speak French or other languages. Language skills are listed on every instructor profile — filter by language when browsing."

### Q: Is SnowPro a ski school?

**AFTER:**
> "No. SnowPro is a booking platform that connects you directly with independent, certified instructors. Think of it as the Airbnb of ski lessons — you pick your instructor, book directly, and they work with you one-on-one. No large group classes, no impersonal school rotation."

## 10. Armenian Market Positioning — Key Copy Principles

### Price Anchoring
Always compare to European alternatives:
- "3-5x cheaper than the Alps"
- "World-class instruction at Armenian prices"
- "Private lessons from $25/hr — try that in Chamonix"

### Proximity Play
Tsaghkadzor's 50-minute distance from Yerevan is a killer advantage:
- "Closer than your commute"
- "Leave Yerevan at 9, be on the slopes by 10"
- "No flights, no hotels — just drive and ride"

### Local Expertise
Instructors who live on these mountains, not seasonal imports:
- "They don't just teach here — they live here"
- "Local pros who know every run, every shortcut, every hidden spot"
- "Your instructor probably grew up on this mountain"

### Trust for Tourists
Russian and Western tourists need assurance:
- "All instructors speak your language"
- "Verified reviews from real students"
- "Secure online payment — no cash hassles on the mountain"

### Seasonal Urgency
Create FOMO without being pushy:
- "Peak season fills fast — January and February book out weeks ahead"
- "The season is short — mid-December to April"
- "Same-day booking available, but don't count on it in peak weeks"
